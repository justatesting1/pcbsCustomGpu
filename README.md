# How to get unitypatcher

You need the JDK to use it. Download the JDK here: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
# How to install
Go to your PCBS path, then you should see a folder called "CustomGPU".
Create a new folder in CustomGPU, name it whatever you want, then put
both of the files into the new folder you just made. Also, put
unitypatcher in that folder too.
Then, double click the .bat file (feel free to edit it) and let it install.
